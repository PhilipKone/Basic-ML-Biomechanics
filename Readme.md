# Basic-ML-Biomechanics - Nicos Haralabidis

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to apply basic machine learning approaches, relying on Pytorch and Scikit-Learn, to open-source biomechanical datasets (e.g., Fukuchi et al., 2018) 
  
## Installation Instructions (tested on Windows OS)
To get started create a conda environment using the `environment.yml` in the base directory:  
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
